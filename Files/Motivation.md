# What I want to be remembered for in the Market Research industry

It is common knowledge that, nowadays, data is everywhere and in vast quantities. However, data in itself holds no value unless one can extract actionable insights that inform decision-making, strategy, and planning.

As someone with a background in Physics and who possesses a solid foundation in mathematics, probability, and statistics, I think my toolkit is very appropriate to implement within the market research domain.

In the future, I'd like to be remembered as someone who not only aptly transformed data into insights for clients, but who also pushed the methodologies and algorithms in market research, maybe implementing something new or optimizing an already existing process. Applying statistics, machine learning, and even Deep learning, if possible, I would like to broaden the spectrum of tools available to make the most out of market research data.

To show why I believe I would be an excellent match for SKIM, I have developed a basic dashboard with Amazon customer reviews for the [_Amazon Echo Show Bluetooth Enabled Speaker_](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Show-Alexa-Enabled-White/dp/B010CEHQTG/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B010CEHQTG&qid=1598392663&sr=8-1), I chose this product for no particular reason other than having a reasonably sized dataset. I decided to go with a dashboard because, as a candidate analyst, what better way to display my motivation than with an analysis?
