- The overall sentiment found along the reviews is positive, which can be seen by the high average sentiment score.
- The high sentiment score is consistent with the fact that, even within the subset of reviews that were found to have negative sentiment, the average product rating is 3.5, which suggests that the overall product was satisfactory. However, the content of the review focused on particular features or issues encountered.
- From the topic modeling, we can find a possible explanation for the behavior found above: the most frequent words encountered withing the negative sentiment reviews have to do with device Setup, voice command, and the Alexa Assistant. Further information could be collected to validate if, for a particular user group, the initial phase of using the product is not very intuitive.
- Another critical point in understanding the negative reviews is that one of the main topics encountered within the positive subset is that people mention receiving the item as a gift or from family. The fact that the product was a gift is important because we may expect that this group might've received some necessary information about the setup and use of the product, in contrast to just buying the product and later finding themselves having trouble with the initial setup. Also, considering another topic for positive reviews is the ease of use of the product, so there's a different experience for a specific subset of users that could be investigated further
